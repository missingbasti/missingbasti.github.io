            "intro": "Near the Old Delhi railway station is a congested location with a quirky name. ‘Pul Mithai’ — a bridge with a sweet connection that goes back to the late 18th century. Pul Mithai is the stretch on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg from Pili Kothi to the junction where it meets Qutb Road and Azad Market road with two railway lines passing below it. The state government’s apathy towards the plight of the homeless was once again highlighted on Wednesday, 6th December 2017 after the police, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF), evicted over 270 families from their settlement on Pul Mithai Bridge in Old Delhi. The eviction drive, according to locals, happened without notice with bulldozers dismantling the shops and the settlements attached to it, creating a horrific scene at 07:00 am in the morning. The market has shut down and locals claim that their belongings were confiscated by the railway police in the process with no hopes of getting it back.",

Poor people, mostly from Rajasthan, were given land by the gram panchayat and they lived peacefully till 2008. That is when trouble started, various government bodies started interfering saying that they have no right over the land and started evicting them every 4 years since 2008 and lot of agony in between. But people always came back and rebuilt. The latest eviction happened in 2017. The police is taking care that no one returns this time. So the people have taken rented places away from here hoping that one day they can come back. One family and a single person stay on despite all odds. That is how a settlement was reduced from over 100 to 2!",

This course has not only made me understand how these people suffer during eviction but also the legalities associated with eviction. I think that there is a necessity to spread a strong message to all the sectors of the society about the unlawful acts which are being carried out in this process of eviction."

The identity of the people and the place is so profound that erasing them forcibly from the face of the city sounds shallow for causes such as urban development and beautification. The journey makes you realize that “Bastis are no problem but a solution for a city that boasts of the country’s second largest per capita income, has an ugly face tucked away in its innards.”"

It will definitely be a grave misdeed if we tend to ignore these problems faced by the inhabitants. It is a high time that “evictions” are replaced with “admittance” along with economic empowerment of the former."

After visiting all the sites and interviewing different people, we collected our data and those data we represented the in the form of timeline, sketches, photographs, audio interviews and plan & section of the settlements. To conclude I would say that the condition of the kidwai nagar slum was very miserable they are just surviving there and waiting for the authorities for relocation of their home, in between they are also struggling for their livelihood and also thinking about what they will do if they are relocated somewhere else. In Janpath the people are living in a better condition then Kidwai Nagar but here the people dont want to move as their livelihood and job is in the near proximity, also they are living in that area for more than 50 years, so they are attached emotionally to the place. The people in both places were feeling insecure and were not mentally stable. The confusion has been created about there life and the question arises \"Is metro life is so cruel to have them\"."

The course also covered the aspect of resettlement of few evicted settlements which helped us identify the people’s concerns regarding the resettlement. The site visits and interviews helped us to conclude that ‘Resettlement is not a problem.. the way it is carried out is a problem’ and also ‘Evictions are not always forced. it is also sometimes a desire of few slum dwellers’."

As a part of this course I learnt about the process of eviction, in some cases it was systematic and well organised whereas in many it was done in a very inhuman way, problems of the slum dwellers, difficulties they face after they are being resettled and tremendous capacity of these people to deal with the same. To summarize the experience was very overwhelming   and it has definitely changed my outlook in the way in which the city needs to be designed and planned. It is very essential to cater the interest of many underprivileged and poor which provides the workforce for city to function than the few elites. Eviction and resettlement is not merely shifting of people from one place to another but far more sensitive and complex issue which needs to deeper understanding of the communities, a lot of study and research.  "

The time when the urban population is expected to grow to 64% by 2050, instead of political statements like 'Jahan jhuggi wha makaan' just for vote bank we i.e. the government, planners, architects, and NGOs need to work as a team to bring in more transparency.
