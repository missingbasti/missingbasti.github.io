            "intro": "Near the Old Delhi railway station is a congested location with a quirky name. ‘Pul Mithai’ — a bridge with a sweet connection that goes back to the late 18th century. Pul Mithai is the stretch on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg from Pili Kothi to the junction where it meets Qutb Road and Azad Market road with two railway lines passing below it. The state government’s apathy towards the plight of the homeless was once again highlighted on Wednesday, 6th December 2017 after the police, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF), evicted over 270 families from their settlement on Pul Mithai Bridge in Old Delhi. The eviction drive, according to locals, happened without notice with bulldozers dismantling the shops and the settlements attached to it, creating a horrific scene at 07:00 am in the morning. The market has shut down and locals claim that their belongings were confiscated by the railway police in the process with no hopes of getting it back.",
