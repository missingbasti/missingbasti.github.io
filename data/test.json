            "intro": "Near the Old Delhi railway station is a congested location with a quirky name. ‘Pul Mithai’ — a bridge with a sweet connection that goes back to the late 18th century. Pul Mithai is the stretch on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg from Pili Kothi to the junction where it meets Qutb Road and Azad Market road with two railway lines passing below it. The state government’s apathy towards the plight of the homeless was once again highlighted on Wednesday, 6th December 2017 after the police, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF), evicted over 270 families from their settlement on Pul Mithai Bridge in Old Delhi. The eviction drive, according to locals, happened without notice with bulldozers dismantling the shops and the settlements attached to it, creating a horrific scene at 07:00 am in the morning. The market has shut down and locals claim that their belongings were confiscated by the railway police in the process with no hopes of getting it back.",

Poor people, mostly from Rajasthan, were given land by the gram panchayat and they lived peacefully till 2008. That is when trouble started, various government bodies started interfering saying that they have no right over the land and started evicting them every 4 years since 2008 and lot of agony in between. But people always came back and rebuilt. The latest eviction happened in 2017. The police is taking care that no one returns this time. So the people have taken rented places away from here hoping that one day they can come back. One family and a single person stay on despite all odds. That is how a settlement was reduced from over 100 to 2!",
