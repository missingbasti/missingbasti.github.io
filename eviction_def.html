            “Not all evictions [are] prohibited under international human rights law. The prohibition of forced eviction does not apply to evictions carried out both in accordance with the law and in conformity with the provision of international human rights treaties. For instance, it may be necessary to displace people from hazard-prone land to protect lives.” 
            <br><br>
            Various elements, separately or combined, define a forced eviction: – A permanent or temporary removal from housing, land or both; – The removal is carried out against the will of the occupants, with or without the use of force; – It can be carried out without the provision of proper alternative housing and relocation, adequate compensation and/or access to productive land, when appropriate; – It is carried out without the possibility of challenging either the decision or the process of eviction, without due process and disregarding the State’s national and international obligations.

            Forced eviction is “the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection”

            The practice of forced evictions involves the involuntary removal of persons from their homes or land, directly or indirectly attributable to the state. The right not to be forcibly evicted is an element of the human right to adequate housing.

        <h2>RESETTLEMENT</h2>
        <div class="col-6">
          Resettlement is the process of moving people to a different place to live, because they are no longer allowed to stay in the same area. In cities, the informally built settlements are found to be evicted due to various reasons including urban development, infrastructure development, urban beautification projects, property market forces, political reasons etc.
          <br><br>
          Delhi has a long history of policies designed to remove Jhuggi-Jhopri (JJ) clusters from the city centre and relocate their residents to the city's periphery, a recent one being the ‘Delhi Slums and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015’. The earlier policies provided the affected households with the land parcels whereas this approach has now shifted to the provision of constructed flats.
        </div>

        <div class="col-6">
          The resettlement colonies are supposed to be planned to provide basic services to the residents which are often absent in the JJ clusters. As they often include households from various settlements around the city, they become a heterogeneous a mix of communities. 
          <br><br>
          While resettlement benefits many, it also disrupts communities and affects livelihoods severely. During the workshop, two resettlement colonies were studied along with the impact of resettlement on people's lives: Madanpur Khadar which was resettled 15 years back and Dwarka Sector 16 which was resettled just a year back. The documentation of both the settlements can be viewed here <a href="http://missingbasti.com/settlement.html?madanpur">(Madanpur Khadar)</a> and here <a href="http://missingbasti.com/settlement.html?dwarka">(Dwarka)</a>
